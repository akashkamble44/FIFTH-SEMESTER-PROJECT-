I have worked on a project titled "Impact of Climate Change on Migratory Birds in India," aiming to identify the most affected bird species, study migration patterns, and investigate the influence of environmental factors through various statistical methods like correlation analysis, regression analysis, log-transformation, Poisson regression, negative binomial regression, boosting technique, bagging technique, support vector regression (SVR), and random forest technique. This diverse range of experiences reflects my commitment to contributing meaningfully to data science research.
